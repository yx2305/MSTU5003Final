                    <h3>Instruction: read the following 10 important facts about standardized test, then answer the questions in part2.</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>For background, SAT and ACT are both standardized tests that colleges use in the admissions process, and schools don't have a preference.</li><br>
                            <li>The purpose of the SAT in the college admissions process really is to allow colleges to benchmark students against each other from across different school districts in the US and abroad.</li><br>
                            <li>A perfect SAT or ACT score alone won’t ensure a student’s ticket into a top U.S. university, but students do need scores that will keep them out of the “no” pile. With admissions rates at the U.S.’s top universities at historic
                                lows, it’s important for students to get a score within the range of the averages at their target schools to even be considered.</li><br>
                            <li>A student wouldn’t go into his or her history final without spending a considerable amount of time studying and preparing, and standardized tests should be no different. In order to improve and avoid the “no” pile, students
                                need to spend time taking practice tests, studying and utilizing test prep resources.</li><br>
                            <li>Building up vocabulary is generally a time consuming but indespensible part to improve standardized test score. However, it's extremely difficult for students to start memorizing hundreds of flash cards in a short period of time close to
                                an exam date.</li><br>
                            <li>By virtue of simply taking one or more full-length practice exams under real test conditions in order to become more familiar with the test, students tend to improve their scores by 30 points. Studies have shown that students
                                who prepare for these tests by focusing on areas of content where they have weakness and practicing test-taking strategies can improve their SAT scores anywhere from 100 to even 400 points, on average. With this level of
                                improvement, students can consider a whole new range of colleges that otherwise would have been out of reach.</li><br>
                            <li>The majority of students typically tend to improve their score on the second time around.</li><br>
                            <li>Colleges will generally look at your highest scores on the three different sections over a couple of different tests if necessary.</li><br>
                            <li>It’s rare for a student to ace the ACT or SAT on the first try. If they wait until
                                the fall of senior year, students might not have enough time to improve should their initial scores fall short of their goal.</li><br>
                            <li>At senior year, the only thing left to do is to actually apply,
                                and college essays are enough work without having to worry about the other factors that may have been neglected prior to senior year. Preparation may seem like a lot of work now, but it will be much harder
                                come admissions season.</li>

                  <h3>How to make the plan?</h3>
                  <p>
                    1. According to what you have learned above, you should plan to take the standardized test at least twice, except if you are in your senior year already and have no time to take the test twice before application. It is also recommended that students do not spend too much time on standardized tests, so you may not want to take the test more than three times. <br><br>
                    2. There should be at least 90 days between any two test dates (except for senior students). You need sufficient time to make significant progress. <br><br>
                    3. Test preparation should be no later than 30 days before the test date. Short term cramming does you no good.<br> <br>
                    4. SAT tests normally are held on January, March, May, June, October, November, and December (mostly on their first Saturday except for January, which is the Saturday around 20th), while ACT tests are held on February, June, September, October, and December (mostly on their second Saturday except for October, which is the Saturday around 20th). So choose your test date(s) accordingly.
